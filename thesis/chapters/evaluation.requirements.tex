\label{Section:Evaluation-Requirements}

The application has some requirements to deliver the correct network topology. Every device on the network must fulfill these requirements:

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run an SNMP daemon.
    \item Support SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c.
    \item Run an LLDP daemon.
    \item LLDP data must be collectible with SNMP.
    \item Each interface port needs to have a unique MAC address.
    \item LLDPd must send the port MAC address as \textit{ChassisID}.
    \item The remote port data must be connected to a local port in the MIB data.
    \item Every network node, that isn't an end node, must send an SNMPv1 trap to the application if the status of an interface changes.
\end{itemize}
