First and foremost, I'd like to thank my thesis advisors Wolfgang Kastner, Dieter Etz and Thomas Fr√ºhwirth for making it possible for me to write about this fascinating subject. When problems arose, it was also always possible to seek assistance.  Theodor Mittermair was another helpful person; he provided additional hardware to test and was always willing to listen. Last but not least, I'd like to thank Julia Kren for her assistance and proofreading.
