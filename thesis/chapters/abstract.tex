Today production facilities are optimized for single products with high quantities. Switching the focus of production requires a lot of preparation, planning, and workforce. With Industry 4.0, interoperability and flexibility of sensors, actuators, and computing units are getting more important. The increased amount of devices makes the reconfiguration of the Industrial Ethernet structures more complex, which can result in long downtimes. Therefore, an automatic discovery mechanism is desired, which allows reconfiguring the network with a single button press.

This thesis implements a prototype of such discovery, it detects devices and their ports with Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and prepares a network graph with the collected data for the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Standard. The prototype was tested in a laboratory environment. It turned out that the functionality was limited by the manufacturers of the network devices used.
